# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Roman</h1>
<p>
I became interested in cloud technologies and development at university, enjoying the challenge of solving technical problems related to network configuration, software installation, and operating system upgrades since I began my career as a system administrator. My passion for IT started when I got my first job in this role. I actively sought out information, particularly on YouTube, where I saved videos on various technical topics and read articles about software installation, creating bootable USB drives, computer networks, and Linux. This led me to experiment with programming; I started with Python, using PyCharm and exploring PostgreSQL to create tables. I even developed a Telegram bot to search for books in a library.
</p>
<p>
My interest in Docker and containerization opened my eyes to DevOps, reinforcing my desire to grow in this field. While working at Bader Ukraine, my enthusiasm for IT, particularly cloud technologies, intensified. I engaged with infrastructure and networks, performed Help Desk tasks, and realized the impact my IT team had on production, which motivated me to excel. During this time, I learned Go and explored web development.
</p>
<p>
In my roles as a monitoring engineer and network engineer at an ISP, I deepened my knowledge of networks, infrastructure, protocols, IP addressing, routing and switching. I also dealt with tasks related to CCTV and Akuvox intercoms and helped build a computer network in a residential complex. Interacting with legal clients as a support engineer provided me with valuable experience in solving infrastructure and network issues. I worked with the Zabbix monitoring system, which piqued my interest in cloud technologies. This led me to apply for the AWS re/Start program from Generation, where I gained experience with AWS services and enhanced my behavioral and communication skills.
</p>
<p>
As a DevOps Engineer, I aim to refine my communication skills and further develop my programming expertise. My extensive experience as a system administrator will serve as a solid foundation as I transition into software development. I have focused on Linux, containerization, orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines, including Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and ArgoCD. Working with infrastructure as code, particularly Terraform, is also an integral part of my technical skill set. I am eager to join a team where I can demonstrate my knowledge and skills while launching my professional career in software development. Beyond just performing my job, I aspire to learn as much as possible to become a proficient DevOps Engineer.
